   ### SUMMARIES OF INTERVIEWS
   Court-1: This user uses Google to search "cheap eats" to find places to eat. They don't always like it because sometimes the places are too far away and the distance this user is willing to travel varies depending on how busy they are. This user prefers scanning a menu quickly for pictures to see if something looks good before reading a description.

   Court-2: This user defaults to known places to eat first but then uses google to find places nearby them. They narrow their search based on what they want to eat. When they are on the go, they go find something simple, like a salad, and don't really refer to food apps. This user doesn't really care about user reviews as they think those types of posts are polarizing. They only use food apps for special occassions. When choosing something to eat, they look for type of food first, then price, then location. This user prefers pictures because they think a picture can tell a lot about a dish more quickly that a description can. This user finds food categories helpful because they have a rescricted diet.

   Marissa-1: This user uses mainly google maps to find food on the go because they think google is easy to get/use on their phone and they think google is "the best". When choosing something to eat, they consider ratings first, pictures second, and distance third. Though they use google primarily, they think that getting a menu is difficult. This user would prefer pictures over a description of the food.

   Marissa-2: This user uses Yelp when they are on the go, and typically for dinner. They like yelp because you can leave reviews and trusted reviews are important to them so that they don't eat someplace bad. This user considers reviews first, price second, and distance third when choosing where to eat. Their favorite function of the Yelp app is leaving reviews, but they think the filter feature on Yelp isn't always accurate. This user would prefer descriptions over pictures.

   Natalie-1: This user relies primarily on the Trip Advisor app because they think the reviews are more trusted than Yelp. They also don't like that the Yelp reviews rarely line up with their own impressions and that Yelp is cluttered and hard to "get to the point". When they are out and about (on foot) they don't look anything up, they will just walk around till find a place and judge it based on the crowd. Mostly use food apps for lunch and dinner. This user prefers a picture over a description and considers price, then menu, then accessability when choosing where to eat.

   Natalie-2: This user doesn't usually use any food apps when choosing where to eat. They do however use google maps to find what's close to them then goes directly to their menu and judges based on that. They also use google when seeking out new places nearby they haven't tried. This user considers how busy the place is/will be (how quickly they will be seated), then the type of food, then the price when picking a place. This user would prefer a description (menu) over a picture of the food, though they admit ideally both would be even better. As a follow up they mentioned that they don't like when other people's reviews "pigeon hole" the filters as they have broad tastes and "don't care" if other people don't like something.

## COMPETING SITE

We were able to find an app called Entree, it was actually very nice looking and appears to have a lot of the features we wanted in our app. However they appear to only be available in NYC and LA. 
Because the features were so similar to our proposal though, we observed two users interacting with the app and here are some observations:
* One user was put off that it was required to geo-locate upon signup, they mentioned that they preferred a place to put in a zip code.
* Neither had any issue signing up/logging in and appeared to interact with the instructions easily.
* Both users didn't really seem to understand the swiping (what it was doing) during the first two or so swipes. However both users realized that if they slow swiped, arrows appear atop of the picture that showed them which way to swipe for good/bad. When I asked later if they didn't understand the instructions page, one user pointed out that the instructions were before the login and before setting their personal settings so that by the time they got to the first food picture they forgot which way they needed to swipe.
* One user commented that though the pictures look amazing, the information provided was lacking. They wanted to know more like at least a price, but also about the restaurant or a description of the food.
* Both users commented that they liked that the app wasn't cluttered looking and that the pictures were nice.
* One user commented that they wished that there were filters for price and/or type of meal (like breakfast, lunch, dinner).
* One user mentioned that the food looked good but there needed to be more info about where to get it. When asked later if a redirct to google maps would be acceptable, they said they'd be ok with that.

## MEETING WITH UX STUDENT JENNIFER
We were fortunate enough to get some feedback from a UX student that helped us bring to light a lot of user preferences we didn't initially think about. She helped us peg down the type of user we were trying to appeal to, namely stoners, vacationers, and business professionals on the go. She stressed to us the need to build trust with the users by pulling in good pictures and having trusted reviews. She also helped us visualize the basic layout. Below are pictures of the notes from our time with her.

## TAKEAWAYS
Taking everything above into account, we have decided that we need to build a sleek app that appeals to a younger, more tech savvy group. Based on the competitor app, we want to expand on their idea in the following ways:

* More information provided, without cluttering the app. We want to include restaurant info (at least a link so that a user can get a menu) and also a link to give the user directions.
* We want the user to be able to filter the distance settings as location/distance was very important to most people we interviewed.
* We want some sort of price indication as well as user reviews. We will start with using the Yelp API, however in future roll-outs we hope to include Trip Advisor.
* We want to give the user the option to just type in their zipcode instead of having location tracking.
